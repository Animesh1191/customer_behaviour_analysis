Customer_Beahviour_Analysis : End-to-End Data Analytics Project

📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis pipeline, starting from raw data processing to actionable business insights. The goal was to analyze [Briefly describe goal, e.g., customer churn / sales trends / supply chain efficiency] to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

Key Objectives:

Clean and preprocess raw data using Python.

Perform structured querying and data management using SQL.

Visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) using Power BI.

Present findings professionally using Gamma App.

📂 Dataset
Source: [Link to Kaggle/Source or "Proprietary Data"]

Description: The dataset contains [Number] rows and [Number] columns, including attributes like [Column 1], [Column 2], and [Column 3].

Time Period: [e.g., Jan 2023 - Dec 2024]

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn for EDA).

Database: SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server).

Visualization: Microsoft Power BI.

Presentation: Gamma AI (for slide deck creation).

IDE/Environment: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code.

🚀 Project Steps & Workflow
1. Data Loading & Cleaning (Python)
Loaded the raw CSV/Excel dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected data types.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify outliers and distributions.

Outcome: A clean, structured dataset ready for database ingestion.

2. Database Management (SQL)
Designed a relational schema and imported the cleaned data into [Your SQL Variant].

Wrote complex SQL queries to extract specific insights (e.g., top-performing categories, month-over-month growth).

Key Query: Calculated [Specific Metric] using Window Functions/CTEs.

3. Dashboarding (Power BI)
Connected Power BI directly to the SQL database.

Created DAX measures for dynamic calculations (e.g., Total Sales, Conversion Rate).

Designed an interactive dashboard with slicers for [Region, Time, Category].

4. Reporting & Presentation
Generated a comprehensive project report summarizing methodologies.

Created a visually engaging presentation deck using Gamma AI to communicate results to non-technical stakeholders.

💡 Key Insights & Results
Based on the analysis, the following conclusions were drawn:

Insight 1: [e.g., Sales peaked in Q4 due to holiday promotions, increasing revenue by 20%.]

Insight 2: [e.g., Customer retention is lowest in the 'Basic Plan' segment.]

Insight 3: [e.g., Region X is underperforming despite high marketing spend.]

Recommendation: [e.g., Shift marketing budget to Region Y and introduce a loyalty program for Basic Plan users.]
